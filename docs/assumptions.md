# Simulation assumptions (draft)

This project uses real Google Ads spend exports, while on-site events and orders are simulated for portfolio purposes.

Planned assumptions:
- Sessions are generated from clicks with controlled noise.
- Funnel probabilities differ by device and landing page.
- Bundles tend to have higher AOV than single products.
- Attribution uses a simple last paid click heuristic.
